<i>Main issues</i></h2>
<p>The ferrets are little animals that were domesticated, in the past people used this animals to country house, their scientific name is "Mustela putorius furo". They have an average length of 51 cm (20 in) including a 13 cm (5.1 in) tail, weigh about 1.5–4 pounds (0.7–2 kg), and have a natural lifespan of 7 to 10 years. They are really friendly and cute, even if the bite a lot, most of the time they are just playing. <br>
<br>Ferrets are also extremely active, love lots of exercise and will want you to play with them every day. They need lots of protein in their diet and digest their food very quickly, they must be fed often,they also need lots of attention from humans and in-cage companions. <br> We have to know that they are really expensive and if you are thinking of having one, you must think if you can maintain this little animal, also if you can pass time with him,aslo they bite a lot and they are not recommended if you have childrens.</p></div> 
	<p>Ferrets are efficient hunters- rodents, rabbits, hares, hedgehogs and reptiles are amongst the prey of their wild polecat ancestors. One interesting thing is that there are five main colours in domesticated ferrets:</p>
	<p><li><b>Fitch (the traditional polecat markings)</b></li>
	<li><b>Albino (also called the English ferret)</b></li>
	<li><b>Silver</b></li>
	<li><b>Sandy</b></li>
		<li><b>Dew</b></li></p>

	<div><p>Even if there are many species of ferrets, every healthy ferret may sleep between 18 and 20 hours a day, also the ferrets use postures and vocalisations to indicate how they’re feeling, for example an excited ferret will make a ‘dook’ sound, also called chuckling; they may also produce a bark-like sound and sometimes do this if they are afraid too.<br>
	<br>Ferrets have a sleek, elongated body and large vertebrae, which allows them to move in confined spaces and turn round in narrow tunnels, as said before, ferrets likes to play with people, other ferrets and toys, you can even see how they really love to play with toys in the next video:</p></div>
